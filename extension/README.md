### Key Components

#### Manifest (manifest.json)

- Configures content scripts and background workers
- Sets up icons and popup interface

#### Popup Interface (popup.html/css/js)

- Handles authentication and analysis requests
- Displays results and provides audio playback

#### Content Script (content.js/css)

### API Integration

The extension integrates with the same Supabase backend as the main Legalish application:

### Security & Privacy
